    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="img/about.png">


    <p>My name is <span>Emily Buickerood</span> and I am a marketing manager/graphic designer, aspiring developer, music lover, coffee addict, avid traveler, horse owner, and self-proclaimed bagel snob. </p>
    <p>I graduated from Philadelphia University in May 2012 with a Bachelors Degree in Graphic Design Communication and have since continued my education by pursing and completing web development courses throughout 2017.</p>
    <p>By day, I am the marketing manager of a veterinary management company where I manage, design and aid in the development of all 36 of our partner's websites as well as their print marketing and email marketing materials. I handle our in-house design work and website management as well.</p>
    <p>By night, I am a freelance designer who enjoys creating websites and print materials for companies and organizations around Philadelphia as well as smaller, more personal projects. I have worked with many members of the food truck industry, small businesses and non-profits, and have created invitations for many types of occasions including bridal showers and weddings.</p>
    <p>Outside of design, you can find me traveling somewhere new, trying restaurants around Philadelphia, or relaxing on the beach. I am constantly in search of a new adventure and always looking for new opportunities! </p>
    <h6>I'd love to chat!</h6>
